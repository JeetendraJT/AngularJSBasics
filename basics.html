<!-- Angular JS extends html attributes by directives -->
<!-- Lets bind module, say it "dummy-module" , it will be referenced in JS file -->
<!-- ***ng-app***   NG has no fullform , it is derived from aNGular (pay attention to upper case letters)
    It is a directive that tells Angular JS that this is a root element for JS application
    Angular JS applications must have a root element(element means tag). An HTML doc can have just one ng-app element(since it is
    a root element)
    It is normally put in html or body tag.
    HTML content insided ng-app can use Angular JS code.

    **************PS : If use more than 1 then only first one is used..**************

    This is set so that Angular JS knows where to start compiling code :) Interesting so far? Keep reading... :D

    ***ng-init***
    It is also a directive that initialize application data by assigning different values to variables

<html ng-app="dummy-module" ng-init="
                                      car = {brand: 'Honda', color: 'white'};
